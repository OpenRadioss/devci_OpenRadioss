FDLIBM (Freely Distributable LIBM) is a C math library 
for machines that support IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic. 
In this release, only double precision is supported.

FDLIBM is intended to provide a reasonably portable (see 
assumptions below), reference quality (below one ulp for
major functions like sin,cos,exp,log) math library 
(libm.a).  For a copy of FDLIBM, please see
